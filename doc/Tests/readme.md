### Guide
>There will be test cases under each test folder. The names of these folders are the same in the outline, so you should be able to quickly find the test cases' descriptions and the expected results.

#### Add Results
>Please move the tested output file into the same folder for whichever trace file you tested. Name the results file: "test_case_1_result.txt".

#### Update "last_tested.md"
>Also, please update the "last_tested.md" file with the latest test dates of each test case so we can keep track of regression testing (testing it again in a new version of simulator) and the result of the test (VALID or INVALID).
